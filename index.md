# Merhaba! 
I'm Mert from Izmir, Turkey. Welcome to my small corner &#x1f64f;

I am working as a software developer.  
Currently, at work I am working towards building a machine learning pipeline.  
In the past, I have worked for Siemens AG. There I was mostly working on embedded linux and devops.  

Once upon a time when I was in college, I was part of a scientific research group. [Here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.05559.pdf) is a paper from those times.

Other than work, music occupies a place in my life. These days sadly I do not make music as much as I would like to however I used to [sing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge9UOFyBrcg) in choirs and [play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJRkVCx2wnw) in a band with my friends when I was college.
